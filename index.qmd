# Active Matter: General Course Description

Active matter represents a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field at the intersection of soft matter physics, biological physics, and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. This course explores systems composed of self-propelled entities that convert energy into directed motion, giving rise to complex collective behaviors and emergent phenomena not found in traditional passive materials.

## Course Overview

The course will examine both natural and synthetic active matter systems across multiple scales:

- **Biological active matter**: From the cytoskeleton and subcellular structures to bacterial suspensions, cell tissues, and animal groups
- **Synthetic active matter**: Including artificial microswimmers, active colloids, and engineered systems that mimic biological functionality

Students will gain a fundamental understanding of how local energy consumption at the individual unit level drives remarkable collective behaviors like self-organization, pattern formation, and spontaneous flows through non-equilibrium processes.

## Key Concepts and Topics

- Foundations of non-equilibrium statistical physics
- Microscopic and continuum theoretical frameworks
- Experimental techniques and model systems
- Self-propulsion mechanisms and motility
- Phase transitions specific to active systems
- Emergence of collective motion and flocking
- Active turbulence and topological defects
- Mechanical properties of active materials
- Biological applications and biomimetic engineering

The course will balance theoretical principles with experimental observations, emphasizing the universal physical mechanisms that govern these diverse systems despite their different microscopic details.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion, students will be able to:
- Identify and analyze active matter systems across disciplines
- Apply theoretical models to predict behavior in active systems
- Understand the key differences between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena
- Connect fundamental physical principles to biological functions
- Appreciate the potential applications in materials science, robotics, and biomedicine

This course is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students with backgrounds in physics, engineering, biophysics, or related fields.
