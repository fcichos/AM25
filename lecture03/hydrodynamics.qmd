## From Swimming to Hydrodynamic Interactions

When microorganisms swim at low Reynolds numbers, they don't just move themselves - they also generate complex flow fields in the surrounding fluid. These flow fields arise directly from the swimming mechanisms we've just explored and have profound implications for how microswimmers interact with their environment and each other.

### The Origin of Hydrodynamic Singularities in Swimming

To understand how swimming generates flow fields, we need to distinguish between two fundamental types of hydrodynamic singularities:

1. **Source/sink dipoles**: These represent the displacement of fluid due to a body moving through it. For a simple model, imagine a sphere moving through fluid - it pushes fluid ahead of it (source) and leaves a vacancy behind it that fluid rushes to fill (sink). These source dipoles:
   - Decay rapidly with distance as $1/r^3$
   - Are responsible for the actual propulsion of the swimmer
   - Arise from the swimmer's shape changes and boundary motion

2. **Force dipoles**: These represent the balance of thrust and drag forces that the swimmer exerts on the fluid. Since microswimmers are force-free (no external forces act on them), the thrust forces must be balanced by drag forces, creating a dipole. These force dipoles:
   - Decay more slowly with distance as $1/r^2$
   - Do not contribute to the swimmer's self-propulsion
   - Dominate the long-range hydrodynamic interactions
   - Classify swimmers as "pushers" or "pullers" based on their swimming mechanism

This distinction is crucial: while source dipoles enable swimming, it's the force dipoles that mediate most of the interesting long-range interactions between microswimmers.

## Hydrodynamic Interactions

Microswimmers not only propel themselves through fluid but also generate these long-range fluid flows that affect the motion of nearby objects and other swimmers. These hydrodynamic interactions play a crucial role in the collective behavior of active matter.

### The Stokes Equation and Green's Function

The flow field generated by a point force (Stokeslet) in an unbounded fluid is described by the Green's function of the Stokes equation:

$$\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{8\pi\eta}\left(\frac{\mathbf{f}}{r} + \frac{(\mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{r})\mathbf{r}}{r^3}\right)$$

where $\mathbf{f}$ is the point force and $\mathbf{r}$ is the position relative to the force application point.

This fundamental solution decays as $1/r$, making hydrodynamic interactions long-ranged. This contrasts with equilibrium systems where interactions typically decay exponentially or as power laws with higher exponents.

### Multipole Expansion

The flow field generated by a microswimmer can be described using a multipole expansion:

$$\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{F} + \nabla \cdot [\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{D}] + \ldots$$

where $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{r})$ is the Oseen tensor (the Green's function), $\mathbf{F}$ is the monopole moment (net force, which vanishes for a force-free swimmer), $\mathbf{D}$ is the dipole moment, and higher-order terms are neglected.

For a force-free swimmer, the leading contribution comes from the force dipole, which decays as $1/r^2$. The symmetry of the dipole classifies swimmers into:

1. **Pushers**: Organisms that generate thrust behind their body, like most bacteria. Their dipole moment is negative.
2. **Pullers**: Organisms that generate thrust in front of their body, like Chlamydomonas (discussed in Lecture 2). Their dipole moment is positive.

### Hydrodynamic Mobility

The hydrodynamic mobility tensor $\mathbf{M}$ relates the velocity of a particle to the forces acting on it:

$$\mathbf{v}_i = \sum_j \mathbf{M}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{F}_j$$

For two spherical particles of radius $a$ in an unbounded fluid, the mobility tensor has the form:

$$\mathbf{M}_{ii} = \frac{1}{6\pi\eta a}\mathbf{I}$$

$$\mathbf{M}_{ij} = \frac{1}{8\pi\eta r_{ij}}\left(\mathbf{I} + \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij}\mathbf{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}^2}\right) \quad (i \neq j)$$

where $\mathbf{r}_{ij}$ is the vector from particle $j$ to particle $i$.

Similar to how temperature couples fluctuations and dissipation in equilibrium systems (as we saw with the FDT in Lecture 2), the mobility tensor in hydrodynamics connects the deterministic response to forces and the correlations in thermal fluctuations:

$$\langle \boldsymbol{\xi}_i(t) \boldsymbol{\xi}_j(t') \rangle = 2k_B T \mathbf{M}_{ij} \delta(t-t')$$

For active particles, this equilibrium relation is violated, providing another manifestation of the non-equilibrium nature of active matter.

## Microswimmer Force Dipoles

Building on the hydrodynamic framework, let's examine more closely how microswimmers generate and are affected by force dipole fields. This fundamental characteristic shapes their interactions and collective behavior.

### Force Dipole Characterization

The force dipole moment of a swimmer can be written as:

$$\mathbf{D} = \int (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0) \otimes \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}$$

where $\mathbf{r}_0$ is the swimmer's center, $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r})$ is the force density exerted by the swimmer on the fluid, and $\otimes$ denotes the tensor product.

For a simple model of a swimmer with thrust force $F$ separated by distance $l$ from a balancing drag force, the dipole strength is $p = Fl$, with $p < 0$ for pushers and $p > 0$ for pullers.

### Far-Field Flow Velocity

The far-field flow velocity generated by a force dipole aligned with the z-axis is:

$$\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{p}{8\pi\eta r^3}(3\cos^2\theta - 1)\mathbf{r}$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{r}$ and the dipole axis.

This flow field has regions of outward flow and inward flow, creating characteristic "pusher" or "puller" signatures that can be visualized experimentally and detected by neighboring particles.

### Induced Interactions

The dipolar flow fields generate effective interactions between swimmers and with boundaries. The interaction energy between two force dipoles separated by distance $r$ with orientations $\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\mathbf{p}_2$ scales as:

$$E_{\text{int}} \sim \frac{p_1 p_2}{r^3}(3(\hat{\mathbf{p}}_1 \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}})(\hat{\mathbf{p}}_2 \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}) - \hat{\mathbf{p}}_1 \cdot \hat{\mathbf{p}}_2)$$

This leads to orientation-dependent attractions and repulsions between swimmers, driving complex collective behaviors:

1. **Pusher-pusher interactions**: Tend to align swimmers parallel when side-by-side and perpendicular when one is behind the other.

2. **Puller-puller interactions**: Tend to align swimmers perpendicular when side-by-side and parallel when one is behind the other.

3. **Mixed interactions**: Create complex alignment patterns depending on relative positions.

### Boundary Effects

The presence of boundaries significantly alters the hydrodynamic interactions. Near a no-slip wall, the force dipole interaction is modified by image singularities, leading to phenomena such as:

1. **Surface accumulation**: Microswimmers tend to accumulate near surfaces, with different mechanisms for pushers and pullers.

2. **Circular motion**: Pushers and pullers display circular trajectories near boundaries with opposite handedness.

3. **Hydrodynamic capture**: Certain configurations of surface curvature can trap swimmers for extended periods.

These boundary effects have no analogs in equilibrium systems and represent another manifestation of the active, non-equilibrium nature of microswimmers.

### Experimental Techniques

Experimentally, force dipoles can be characterized through:

1. **Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)**: Measures flow fields around swimming microorganisms, revealing their dipolar nature.

2. **Tracer particle dynamics**: The motion of passive tracers in the vicinity of a swimmer follows the dipolar flow fields.

3. **Optical tweezers**: Can directly measure the forces exerted by microswimmers.

These techniques provide direct evidence for the non-equilibrium nature of microswimmer-generated flows, connecting to the broader theme of detailed balance violation that we discussed in Lecture 2 for flagellar beating patterns.
