### Key examples across biological and synthetic systems

Active matter encompasses a diverse range of systems spanning biological and synthetic domains:

1. **Biological active matter**
   - **Cytoskeletal networks**: Actin filaments and microtubules with molecular motors that drive cell division, motility, and shape changes
   - **Bacterial suspensions**: Dense colonies of swimming bacteria like E. coli that exhibit collective motion and turbulent-like flows
   - **Cell sheets and tissues**: Epithelial monolayers that display collective migration during wound healing and morphogenesis
   - **Animal collectives**: Flocking birds, schooling fish, and insect swarms demonstrating emergent group behaviors
   - **Subcellular organelles**: Active droplets and membrane-less organelles that undergo phase separation driven by metabolic activity

2. **Synthetic active matter**
   - **Janus particles**: Colloids with asymmetric surface properties that enable self-propulsion through chemical or thermal gradients
   - **Light-activated swimmers**: Particles containing photosensitive materials that convert light energy into directed motion
   - **Magnetically driven systems**: Artificial swimmers controlled by external magnetic fields
   - **Active liquid crystals**: Nematic liquid crystals with embedded energy-consuming components that create topological defects and flow patterns
   - **Vibration-powered granular matter**: Macroscopic particles energized by mechanical vibrations exhibiting fluidization and pattern formation
   - **Chemically-powered colloids**: Particles utilizing catalytic reactions (e.g., platinum-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide decomposition) for propulsion
