This course explores systems composed of self-propelled entities that convert energy into directed motion, giving rise to complex collective behaviors and emergent phenomena not found in traditional passive materials.\n\n## Course Overview\n\nThe course will examine both natural and synthetic active matter systems across multiple scales:\n\n- **Biological active matter**: From the cytoskeleton and subcellular structures to bacterial suspensions, cell tissues, and animal groups\n- **Synthetic active matter**: Including artificial microswimmers, active colloids, and engineered systems that mimic biological functionality\n\nStudents will gain a fundamental understanding of how local energy consumption at the individual unit level drives remarkable collective behaviors like self-organization, pattern formation, and spontaneous flows through non-equilibrium processes.\n\n## Key Concepts and Topics\n\n- Foundations of non-equilibrium statistical physics\n- Microscopic and continuum theoretical frameworks\n- Experimental techniques and model systems\n- Self-propulsion mechanisms and motility\n- Phase transitions specific to active systems\n- Emergence of collective motion and flocking\n- Active turbulence and topological defects\n- Mechanical properties of active materials\n(- Biological applications and biomimetic engineering)\n\nThe course will balance theoretical principles with experimental observations, emphasizing the universal physical mechanisms that govern these diverse systems despite their different microscopic details.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nUpon completion, students will be able to:\n- Identify and analyze active matter systems across disciplines\n- Apply theoretical models to predict behavior in active systems\n- Understand the key differences between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena\n- Connect fundamental physical principles to biological functions\n- Appreciate the potential applications in materials science, robotics, and biomedicine\n\nThis course is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students with backgrounds in physics, engineering, biophysics, or related fields.\n\n",
