Here, we review key concepts that will be essential for our study of active systems.\n\n### Canonical ensemble and partition function\n\nFor a system in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at temperature $T$, the probability of finding the system in a microstate with energy $E_i$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n\n$$P_i = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta E_i}$$\n\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $Z$ is the partition function:\n\n$$Z = \\sum_i e^{-\\beta E_i}$$\n\nIn physical terms, the Boltzmann distribution reflects how energy is partitioned among the available states at thermal equilibrium. States with lower energy are exponentially more likely to be occupied than states with higher energy. For active matter systems, this distribution is significantly altered because energy is continuously injected at the microscopic level, driving the system away from this equilibrium distribution.\n\nThe partition function is central to statistical mechanics as it connects microscopic properties to macroscopic observables. For instance, the average energy is:\n\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta}$$\n\nThis relationship highlights how the partition function serves as a generating function for thermodynamic quantities. When studying active matter, we'll see that traditional partition functions often cannot be defined because these systems don't explore phase space according to Boltzmann statistics.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Sedimentation Example\n\n\n::: {#fig-perrin-sedimentation }\n\n![](/assets/images/lecture02/sedimentation_perrin.png){width=50%}\n\nPerrin's sedimentation experiments. The exponential decay in the number density of colloidal particles with height directly confirmed the Boltzmann distribution and provided key evidence for the atomic theory of matter.\n:::\n\nA clear demonstration of the Boltzmann distribution's power can be derived from the canonical partition function using the barometric distribution of particles in a gravitational field. Consider colloidal particles suspended in a fluid in a gravitational field $g$.\n\nFor this system, we can construct the partition function by integrating over all possible heights:\n\n$$Z = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta E(h)} dh = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta mgh} dh = \\frac{1}{\\beta mg}$$\n\nThe probability density for finding a particle at height $h$ is:\n\n$$P(h) = \\frac{e^{-\\beta mgh}}{Z} = \\beta mg e^{-\\beta mgh}$$\n\nFrom this, we can derive the number density $n(h)$ by multiplying by the total number of particles $N$:\n\n$$n(h) = N \\cdot P(h) = N \\beta mg e^{-\\beta mgh}$$\n\nIf we define $n_0$ as the density at $h=0$, then $n_0 = N \\beta mg$, and we obtain:\n\n$$n(h) = n_0 e^{-\\beta mgh} = n_0 e^{-\\frac{mgh}{k_B T}}$$\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides:\n\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{n(h)}{n_0}\\right) = -\\beta mgh = -\\frac{mgh}{k_B T}$$\n\nThis direct connection between the partition function and the observable barometric distribution provides a compelling experimental verification of statistical mechanics. Jean Perrin used this relationship in 1908 to experimentally determine Avogadro's number and provide crucial evidence for the atomic theory of matter. Today, similar experiments with colloidal particles serve as textbook demonstrations of statistical mechanics in action.\n\n\n:::\n\n### Free energy and thermodynamic potentials\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy $F$ is related to the partition function by:\n\n$$F = -k_B T \\ln Z$$\n\nThis relationship allows us to calculate thermodynamic quantities such as entropy $S$:\n\n$$S = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = k_B \\ln Z + \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T}$$\n\nFor systems with fixed particle number, volume, and temperature (canonical ensemble), minimizing $F$ determines the equilibrium state.\n\nThe principle of free energy minimization is particularly important for understanding the contrast with active systems. In active matter, free energy is constantly being pumped into the system through microscopic driving mechanisms (e.g., molecular motors in cell cytoskeleton, metabolic processes in bacteria, or artificial propulsion mechanisms in synthetic swimmers). Consequently, these systems cannot be described by a minimum free energy principle, which is a fundamental departure from equilibrium thermodynamics.\n\n### Ergodicity and detailed balance\n\nA key assumption in equilibrium statistical mechanics is ergodicityâ€”the equivalence between time averages and ensemble averages:\n\n$$\\langle A \\rangle_{\\text{time}} = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T A(t) dt = \\langle A \\rangle_{\\text{ensemble}}$$\n\nIn practical terms, ergodicity means that if you observe a single system for a sufficiently long time, it will eventually visit all microscopic states consistent with its macroscopic constraints, allowing time averages to equal ensemble averages. Active matter systems often violate ergodicity by persistently exploring only a subset of the available phase space due to their self-propulsion mechanisms. This has profound implications for both experimental measurements and theoretical descriptions of active systems.\n\nEquilibrium dynamics satisfies detailed balance, a microscopic time-reversal symmetry condition. For transitions between states $i$ and $j$ with rates $W_{i\\to j}$ and $W_{j\\to i}$:\n\n$$\\frac{W_{i\\to j}}{W_{j\\to i}} = \\frac{P_j^{\\text{eq}}}{P_i^{\\text{eq}}} = e^{-\\beta(E_j-E_i)}$$\n\nDetailed balance ensures that there are no net probability currents in equilibrium.\n\n\n### Example: Two Brownian particles with non-uniform temperatures\n\nTo concretely illustrate how equilibrium concepts apply to coupled systems and how they break down when thermal equilibrium is violated, let's consider a simple model: two Brownian particles connected by springs, with different temperatures.\n\nConsider the following system:\n- Two Brownian particles with positions $x_1$ and $x_2$\n- Particle 1 is connected to a fixed wall by a spring with constant $k_1$\n- The two particles are connected to each other by a spring with constant $k_2$\n- Particle 2 is connected to a fixed wall by a spring with constant $k_3$\n- Particle 1 experiences thermal fluctuations at temperature $T_1$\n- Particle 2 experiences thermal fluctuations at temperature $T_2$\n\nThe Langevin equations for this system are:\n\n$$\\gamma_1 \\frac{dx_1}{dt} = -k_1 x_1 - k_2(x_1 - x_2) + \\xi_1(t)$$\n$$\\gamma_2 \\frac{dx_2}{dt} = -k_3 x_2 - k_2(x_2 - x_1) + \\xi_2(t)$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma_i$ are the friction coefficients and $\\xi_i(t)$ are Gaussian white noises with:\n\n$$\\langle \\xi_i(t) \\rangle = 0, \\quad \\langle \\xi_i(t) \\xi_i(t') \\rangle = 2\\gamma_i k_B T_i \\delta(t-t')$$\n\nWhen $T_1 = T_2$, this system is in thermal equilibrium, and the probability distribution for the positions follows the Boltzmann distribution:\n\n$$P(x_1, x_2) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{k_B T}[k_1 x_1^2/2 + k_2(x_1-x_2)^2/2 + k_3 x_2^2/2]\\right)$$\n\nHowever, when $T_1 \\neq T_2$, the system is driven out of equilibrium, leading to a non-Boltzmann stationary distribution. The correlation between $x_1$ and $x_2$ encodes information about the non-equilibrium nature of the system.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-current .cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](lecture02_files/figure-html/fig-current-output-1.png){#fig-current}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this non-equilibrium scenario, energy flows from the hotter to the colder particle, driving the system away from equilibrium. The stationary state represents a balance between this energy flow and dissipation, rather than a state of maximum entropy as in equilibrium systems. The detailed balance condition is violated, and the system exhibits persistent probability currents in phase space - a hallmark of non-equilibrium behavior.\n\nThe violation of detailed balance is perhaps the most direct signature of non-equilibrium behavior in active matter. For example, in bacterial suspensions, each bacterium consumes energy to propel itself in a persistent direction, creating microscopic probability currents that have no counterpart in equilibrium systems. These probability currents can lead to emergent macroscopic phenomena such as collective motion, phase separation without attractive interactions (known as motility-induced phase separation), and other surprising collective behaviors that would be thermodynamically prohibited in equilibrium systems.\n\n### Phase space and Liouville's theorem\n\nFor classical systems with positions $\\mathbf{q}$ and momenta $\\mathbf{p}$, the phase space distribution function $\\rho(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p},t)$ evolves according to Liouville's equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = -\\{\\rho, H\\}$$\n\nwhere $\\{\\cdot,\\cdot\\}$ denotes the Poisson bracket and $H$ is the Hamiltonian. At equilibrium, $\\rho$ is time-independent and given by:\n\n$$\\rho_{\\text{eq}}(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta H(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p})}$$\n\nLiouville's theorem states that the phase space density behaves like an incompressible fluid - it cannot be created or destroyed, only redistributed. In active systems, this fundamental conservation law is violated because the microscopic dynamics cannot be derived from a Hamiltonian. Instead, active systems require modified descriptions that account for energy injection and dissipation at the particle level.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, this means that we need to extend our theoretical frameworks beyond Hamiltonian mechanics when studying active matter. Statistical field theories, stochastic thermodynamics, and kinetic theories have all been adapted and extended to describe the phase space evolution of active systems.\n\n### Brownian motion and the Langevin equation\n\nBrownian motion provides a simple yet powerful model for understanding thermal fluctuations. The Langevin equation describes the motion of a Brownian particle:\n\n$$m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\\gamma\\frac{dx}{dt} - \\frac{dU(x)}{dx} + \\xi(t)$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the friction coefficient, $U(x)$ is the potential energy, and $\\xi(t)$ is Gaussian white noise with:\n\n$$\\langle\\xi(t)\\rangle = 0, \\quad \\langle\\xi(t)\\xi(t')\\rangle = 2\\gamma k_B T \\delta(t-t')$$\n\nThe noise amplitude is related to the friction coefficient through the fluctuation-dissipation relation, a consequence of thermal equilibrium.\n\nFor master students approaching active matter, it's crucial to understand that the Langevin equation serves as a conceptual bridge between equilibrium and non-equilibrium physics. To model active particles, we typically modify this equation by adding a self-propulsion term. For example, the simplest model of an active Brownian particle (ABP) adds a propulsion force of constant magnitude but changing direction:\n\n$$\\gamma\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = -\\nabla U(\\mathbf{r}) + \\gamma v_0 \\mathbf{n}(t) + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t)$$\n\nwhere $v_0$ is the swimming speed and $\\mathbf{n}(t)$ is a unit vector that undergoes rotational diffusion. This seemingly simple modification leads to profound physical consequences, including enhanced diffusion, boundary accumulation, and novel collective behaviors.\n\nIn the overdamped limit, which is often relevant for colloidal systems and active matter, inertial effects can be neglected:\n\n$$\\gamma\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\frac{dU(x)}{dx} + \\xi(t)$$\n\nThis overdamped approximation is particularly relevant for microscopic active systems like bacterial suspensions, catalytic Janus particles, or colloidal rollers, where the Reynolds number is extremely low (typically 10^-5 to 10^-2). In these systems, viscous forces dominate over inertial forces, meaning that particles stop moving almost instantaneously when propulsion ceases - a counterintuitive regime compared to our macroscopic experience.\n\nThis framework will serve as our starting point for understanding how active systems systematically violate equilibrium principles. As we'll see in subsequent sections, active matter requires expanding our theoretical tools beyond equilibrium statistical mechanics to account for the continuous energy input that drives these fascinating systems far from equilibrium.\n\n\n## Fluctuation-dissipation theorem and its breakdown\n\nThe fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) represents one of the cornerstones of equilibrium statistical mechanics, establishing a fundamental relationship between the response of a system to small external perturbations and its spontaneous fluctuations at thermal equilibrium. However, this elegant theorem breaks down in active matter systems, providing a clear signature of non-equilibrium behavior.\n\nLet's begin with a precise formulation of the FDT in equilibrium systems. Consider a system described by a set of variables $\\{x_i\\}$. The response function $\\chi_{ij}(t-t')$ quantifies how the average value of $x_i$ at time $t$ changes due to a small perturbation applied to $x_j$ at an earlier time $t'$:\n\n$$\\chi_{ij}(t-t') = \\frac{\\delta \\langle x_i(t) \\rangle}{\\delta h_j(t')}$$\n\nwhere $h_j$ represents an external field conjugate to $x_j$, and $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes an ensemble average.\n\nThe correlation function $C_{ij}(t-t')$, on the other hand, measures the statistical correlation between spontaneous fluctuations of the variables:\n\n$$C_{ij}(t-t') = \\langle x_i(t) x_j(t') \\rangle - \\langle x_i(t) \\rangle \\langle x_j(t') \\rangle$$\n\nThe fluctuation-dissipation theorem connects these two quantities. For a system at thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, the theorem states:\n\n$$\\chi_{ij}(t-t') = -\\frac{1}{k_B T} \\frac{d}{dt} C_{ij}(t-t') \\quad \\text{for } t > t'$$\n\nwhere $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant. In the frequency domain, this relationship becomes:\n\n$$\\chi_{ij}''(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega}{2k_B T} C_{ij}(\\omega)$$\n\nwhere $\\chi_{ij}''(\\omega)$ is the imaginary part of the Fourier transform of the response function, and $C_{ij}(\\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the correlation function.\n\nTo derive this result, we can start from the Langevin equation for a Brownian particle in a potential $U(x)$:\n\n$$m\\ddot{x} + \\gamma \\dot{x} + \\nabla U(x) = \\xi(t)$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the friction coefficient and $\\xi(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise with $\\langle \\xi(t) \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle \\xi(t) \\xi(t') \\rangle = 2\\gamma k_B T \\delta(t-t')$.\n\nIn the overdamped limit, which is relevant for most microscopic systems, this simplifies to:\n\n$$\\gamma \\dot{x} = -\\nabla U(x) + \\xi(t)$$\n\nFor small displacements around an equilibrium position, we can linearize the potential and calculate both the response function and the correlation function explicitly. The result confirms the fluctuation-dissipation relation.\n\nThe physical interpretation of the FDT is profound: the same microscopic processes that cause dissipation when the system is perturbed externally also drive the spontaneous fluctuations at equilibrium. Or conversely, the system's response to external perturbations can be predicted from knowledge of its equilibrium fluctuations.\n\nIn active matter systems, however, the FDT breaks down systematically. Active matter encompasses systems composed of self-propelled units that convert stored or ambient energy into directed motion. Examples include bacterial suspensions, cellular tissues, bird flocks, and artificial microswimmers.\n\nFor active systems, we can quantify the breakdown of the FDT by defining an effective temperature $T_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$ through:\n\n$$T_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega C_{ij}(\\omega)}{2k_B \\chi_{ij}''(\\omega)}$$\n\nIn equilibrium systems, $T_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = T$ is constant across all frequencies. In active systems, $T_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$ becomes frequency-dependent, often showing dramatic deviations from the bath temperature at frequencies related to active processes.\n\nConsider a simple model of active matter: a particle subject to both thermal noise and an active force $f_a(t)$:\n\n$$\\gamma \\dot{x} = -\\nabla U(x) + \\xi(t) + f_a(t)$$\n\nThe active force typically has a finite correlation time $\\tau_a$ and strength characterized by an active diffusion coefficient $D_a$:\n\n$$\\langle f_a(t) f_a(t') \\rangle = \\gamma^2 D_a \\exp(-|t-t'|/\\tau_a)$$\n\nSolving this model shows that the correlation function $C(\\omega)$ receives contributions from both thermal and active processes, while the response function $\\chi''(\\omega)$ remains determined solely by the dissipative properties of the medium. This mismatch leads to a violation of the FDT.\n\nThe extent of FDT violation can be quantified by the ratio:\n\n$$\\frac{T_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)}{T} = 1 + \\frac{D_a \\tau_a}{D} \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2 \\tau_a^2}$$\n\nwhere $D = k_B T/\\gamma$ is the equilibrium diffusion coefficient. At low frequencies ($\\omega \\tau_a \\ll 1$), the effective temperature can be much larger than the bath temperature if $D_a \\tau_a \\gg D$, indicating strong non-equilibrium effects. At high frequencies ($\\omega \\tau_a \\gg 1$), thermal effects dominate and $T_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) \\approx T$.\n\nThe breakdown of the FDT has important practical consequences. In active systems, measurements of spontaneous fluctuations cannot be used to predict the response to external perturbations using equilibrium statistical mechanics. Conversely, the violation of the FDT provides a quantitative tool to characterize the non-equilibrium nature of active systems, even when the microscopic details of active processes are unknown.\n\nThis FDT violation is closely connected to entropy production, which we will explore next as a fundamental measure of the arrow of time in non-equilibrium systems.\n\n",
