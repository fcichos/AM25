## Entropy production in active systems

Entropy production lies at the heart of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and provides a quantitative measure of how far a system is driven from equilibrium. While equilibrium systems maximize their entropy and remain there, active systems continuously produce entropy, reflecting their persistent consumption of energy to maintain non-equilibrium steady states.

### Definition and physical meaning

The total entropy production rate can be split into two contributions:

$$\dot{S}_{tot} = \dot{S}_{sys} + \dot{S}_{env}$$

where $\dot{S}_{sys}$ is the rate of change of the system's Shannon entropy and $\dot{S}_{env}$ is the entropy production rate in the environment. In a steady state, $\dot{S}_{sys} = 0$, so $\dot{S}_{tot} = \dot{S}_{env} > 0$.

For a system described by a probability distribution $P(\mathbf{x},t)$ over states $\mathbf{x}$, the entropy production rate can be expressed as:

$$\dot{S}_{tot} = k_B \int d\mathbf{x} \, J(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot F(\mathbf{x},t) \geq 0$$

where $J(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the probability current and $F(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the thermodynamic force. This formula reveals a profound insight: entropy production occurs when probability currents flow along thermodynamic forces.

### Connection to probability currents

The probability currents we observed in our examples—the two Brownian particles with different temperatures and the Chlamydomonas flagella—directly contribute to entropy production. In fact, these circulatory flows in phase space are not just signatures of non-equilibrium behavior; they quantify the system's entropy production rate.

For Brownian dynamics in the overdamped regime, the entropy production rate can be written as:

$$\dot{S}_{tot} = \frac{k_B}{\gamma} \int d\mathbf{x} \, \frac{|J(\mathbf{x})|^2}{P(\mathbf{x})}$$

This expression makes a remarkable connection: the entropy production rate is proportional to the squared magnitude of the probability current density normalized by the probability distribution. Systems with stronger circulation in probability space produce entropy at a higher rate.

### Experimental measurement

How can we actually measure entropy production in experiment? Several approaches have been developed:

1. **Current-based methods**: By measuring the probability density and current as in our examples with two Brownian particles and Chlamydomonas, we can directly compute the entropy production using the formula above.

2. **Trajectory-based methods**: For single-particle tracking data, the entropy production can be estimated by:

   $$\dot{S}_{est} = \frac{1}{4\tau} \sum_i \left\langle \left( \frac{p(x_i \to x_{i+1})}{p(x_{i+1} \to x_i)} \right) \right\rangle$$

   where $p(x_i \to x_{i+1})$ represents the transition probability between states observed in the trajectory.

3. **Time asymmetry methods**: By quantifying the statistical irreversibility of trajectories:

   $$\dot{S}_{est} = \frac{k_B}{\tau} D_{KL}(P[X(t)] || P[\tilde{X}(t)])$$

   where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability distributions of forward trajectories $X(t)$ and time-reversed trajectories $\tilde{X}(t)$.

### Entropy production in specific active systems

Different active systems show distinctive patterns of entropy production:

1. **Self-propelled particles**: For active Brownian particles with persistent motion, entropy production scales with the square of the active force and inversely with the rotational diffusion coefficient:

   $$\dot{S}_{tot} \approx \frac{k_B v_0^2}{2D_r}$$

   where $v_0$ is the swimming speed and $D_r$ is the rotational diffusion coefficient.

2. **Molecular motors**: For molecular motors like kinesin or myosin, entropy production is directly linked to ATP hydrolysis:

   $$\dot{S}_{tot} \approx \frac{k_B \Delta\mu}{k_B T} r_{ATP}$$

   where $\Delta\mu$ is the chemical potential difference from ATP hydrolysis and $r_{ATP}$ is the ATP consumption rate.

3. **Tissue dynamics**: In cellular tissues, entropy production has been linked to cell division, death, and migration processes. Recent studies have used optically-driven phase transitions to quantify entropy production in living tissues.

### Minimum entropy production principles

In contrast to the maximum entropy principle of equilibrium systems, some non-equilibrium steady states follow a principle of minimum entropy production, where the system adopts the configuration that produces entropy at the minimum rate required to maintain its non-equilibrium state.

However, active matter systems typically operate far from the near-equilibrium regime where this principle applies. Instead, they exist in regimes of strong driving where entropy production can be significant and is often channeled into performing useful functions like motility, transport, or pattern formation.


## Time-reversal symmetry breaking

Time-reversal symmetry is a fundamental concept describing whether the laws governing a system's dynamics are invariant under the transformation $t \to -t$. While microscopic physical laws are largely time-reversal invariant, macroscopic behaviors often show a clear arrow of time due to statistical considerations embodied in the second law of thermodynamics.

### Formal definition

A system has time-reversal symmetry if the probability of observing a trajectory $\Gamma = \{x(t_0), x(t_1), ..., x(t_N)\}$ equals the probability of observing the reversed trajectory $\tilde{\Gamma} = \{x(t_N), x(t_{N-1}), ..., x(t_0)\}$ when appropriately accounting for the initial conditions:

$$P[\Gamma|x(t_0)] = P[\tilde{\Gamma}|x(t_N)]$$

In equilibrium systems, this symmetry is guaranteed by detailed balance. However, active systems break this symmetry, leading to trajectories that look fundamentally different when viewed forward versus backward in time.

### Connection to detailed balance

As we saw earlier, detailed balance requires:

$$W_{i \to j} P_i^{eq} = W_{j \to i} P_j^{eq}$$

This microscopic reversibility ensures that any net flow between states vanishes at equilibrium. When detailed balance is violated—as in all active systems—we observe:

$$W_{i \to j} P_i^{ss} \neq W_{j \to i} P_j^{ss}$$

where $P^{ss}$ represents the non-equilibrium steady state. This inequality manifests as persistent circulation patterns in the probability currents, which we observed in our examples.

### Quantifying time-reversal symmetry breaking

Time-reversal symmetry breaking can be quantified using several approaches:

1. **Irreversibility measure**: For a stationary process, the degree of irreversibility can be quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence:

   $$I = D_{KL}(P[\Gamma] || P[\tilde{\Gamma}]) = \left\langle \ln \frac{P[\Gamma]}{P[\tilde{\Gamma}]} \right\rangle_\Gamma$$

   This measure quantifies how distinguishable the forward and time-reversed processes are.

2. **Cycling frequencies**: In systems that exhibit cyclic behavior (like the Chlamydomonas flagella), the net cycling frequency in phase space provides a direct measure of time-reversal symmetry breaking:

   $$\omega_{cycling} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_C \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})}{P(\mathbf{x})} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

   where the integral is taken around a closed loop in phase space.

3. **Area encircled by probability currents**: The area enclosed by probability current loops in phase space directly quantifies the magnitude of time-reversal symmetry breaking.

### Observational consequences

Time-reversal symmetry breaking manifests in various observable phenomena:

1. **Emergent currents**: Persistent macroscopic currents can emerge even without external gradients, as seen in active turbulence or bacterial suspensions.

2. **Odd elasticity**: Active materials can exhibit "odd" or non-reciprocal mechanical responses that would be forbidden in equilibrium systems.

3. **Directed transport**: Active systems can perform directed transport against external gradients without violating the second law, as biological molecular motors demonstrate.

4. **Chirality and ratchet effects**: Time-reversal symmetry breaking often leads to preferential motion in one direction, which can be leveraged to design molecular ratchets and motors.

### The arrow of time in active systems

In active systems, the arrow of time manifests not just at the macroscopic level (as it does in passive systems through the second law) but also at the mesoscopic level of individual active agents.

Consider again our Chlamydomonas example: the flagellar beating cycle has a well-defined sequence that breaks time-reversal symmetry at the scale of the individual cell. Playing a video of the flagellar motion backward would immediately reveal that something is "wrong," even without statistical analysis.

This microscopic breaking of time-reversal symmetry distinguishes active matter from passive non-equilibrium systems, where the arrow of time typically emerges only at macroscopic scales or through statistical averages.

The magnitude of time-reversal symmetry breaking in active systems is directly related to their energy consumption rate. More energy input generally leads to stronger breaking of time-reversal symmetry, creating systems that are further from equilibrium and capable of more complex emergent behaviors.

In conclusion, time-reversal symmetry breaking provides a fundamental lens through which we can understand active matter. By quantifying this symmetry breaking, we gain insight into the essential non-equilibrium character of active systems and the mechanisms through which they harness energy to perform biological functions or create novel material properties.
